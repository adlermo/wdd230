          The page as shown above presents repetition technique — among other
          principles of good design — on the cards along the page. Each of them
          presents a title, a description and the dominant technology on the
          repositories and, by doing so it creates a pleasant and easy pattern
          to the users.

        <h4>Fitt's Law</h4>
        <p>Microsoft Learn Platform</p>

        <p>
          Accessing Microsoft Learning Platform with an personal account we can
          see Fitt's Law by the position of <em>"Resume"</em> buttons, which are
          placed on the right (closer to the thumb) and in a bigger button.
          Their positioning enhance time on pressing forward on studies and I
          believe it encourages users to keep learning at the same.

          Solving the problem of ads using an ad blocker, we'll realize Hick's
          law acting in the page. As a tech news web portal
          <strong>Olhar Digital</strong> removed from its header anything but
          their logo making content around the info article less distractive and
          easier to make choices (scroll down). Their home page does the same by
          showing only 2 articles in a row.
